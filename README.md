Notes:
- This repo may be referenced in some of my other projects.<br>
- This is intended to show you how to install arTIfiCE and CalcPlex on the TI-84 Plus CE Python.
- This is simply a written version of the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0H2nl75TA) _\(Which itsself is a video version of another, longer, written tutorial\)_.

### On computer
1. Upload **[CabriJr_CE.8ek](CabriJr_CE.8ek)** and **[Jailbreak.8xg](Jailbreak.8xg)**
	- Make sure each program has the location properly set to RAM or Archive according to [Instructions1.png](Instructions1.png)

### On Calculator
2. \[_apps_\] -> CabriJr
3. \[_f1_\] -> Open... -> ARTIFICE -> CALCPLEX
4. \[_quit_\]
5. You can now run asm programs through \[_apps_\] -> CalcPlex
<br><br><br>
- Although this installation is persistant through turning the calculator off and on, you will have to redo all of this after the calculator is reset(like after a PAT when they format/factory-reset your calculator ðŸ¥²)
