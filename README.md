This is intended to show how to install arTIfiCE and CalcPlex on the TI-84 Plus CE Python.

This is simply a written version of the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0H2nl75TA)

1. On computer - Upload CabriJr.8ek and Jailbreak.8xg
	1.1 look at Instructions1.png to make sure everything RAM and Archive are correct for each program

2. On calc - apps -> CabriJr
3. \[y=\] -> Open... -> ARTIFICE -> CALCPLEX
4. \[quit\]
5. After running once, never have to run again, now can just run programs through \[apps\] -> CalcPlex - even after turning the calculator off and on
<br><br><br>
- HAVE TO REDO ALL OF THIS AFTER CALC IS RESET
